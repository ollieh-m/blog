<%= para do %>
  Welcome to my blog. This is the first thing I'm posting, so it's not much of a blog yet. Sorry. And I have no idea what it will become, because it's mainly an experiment to find out
  <%= list do %>
    a) whether I have anything to say
    b) (if a) whether I find it useful or otherwise rewarding to share those things publicly, and
    c) (if a and b) whether I can find the time to write things regularly
  <% end %>
<% end %>

<%= para do %>
  I decided to try this experiment a few months ago, because every now and then I do have an idea for something I might like to share with The World or my future self - something I've learnt or thought through that might be interesting to others or that I might want crystalised for future reference. But I'm never <%= italic "sure" %> if I'd really like going to the trouble of forming it into a shareable Thing or how I'd feel about it being public and (maybe) seen. And I realised - talking about this pointless uncertainty with a colleague - that the only way to find out is to give it a go. So I committed to starting a blog and finding out, and I set myself a deadline: share a first post before July.
<% end %>

<%= para do %>
  Well, it's nearly the end of June, and this is that first post. It's about this blog: the why (above) and (below) the how.

  How I Made This Blog...
<% end %>

<%= para do %>
  I've never had a blog before. I've never used Wordpress. My only technical experience with any blog was helping to put together the bare bones of a <%= link_to "Jekyll", "https://jekyllrb.com" %> site and host it on Github pages for a client at my previous job. 
<% end %>

<%= para do %>
  I was a bit apprehensive about delving into the ocean of blog-building and -hosting tools. I feared a blind Google would be overwhelming. So instead I started by thinking about what site really is and the simplest way I could achieve it.
<% end %>

<%= para do %>
  A blog is a site with some pages. Yes, each page could be made from content stored in a database or some filesystem in the cloud. But pretty quickly I decided for me the easiest way to write, format and store an article would be to add an html file into the site repository - or, more precisely, as a (mainly) Rails developer, to add an <%= inline_code "html.erb" %> view into a Rails app.
<% end %>

<%= para do %>
  (This was essentially how I remember the Jekyll blog working that I helped with: add an article by adding a file (written with some nice, convenient markup) into a repo. And I remember liking that simplicity.)
<% end %>

<%= para do %>
  But I could also see the benefits of having articles in a database. It would be a lot easier to make updates through a web interface, without editing code and redeploying. That wasn't really an issue for me - I'm happy enough editing <%= inline_code "html.erb" %> files. 
<% end %>

<%= para do %>
  But if articles were in a database, I could also easily store information about them (a timestamp, description, title, view count) <%= italic "and" %> create relations between articles and other things like likes, keywords and categories. 
<% end %>

<%= para do %>
  So I wondered if I could both
  <%= list do %>
    a) store the content of each article as a Rails view - which I'd edit locally and deploy - while <%= italic "also" %>
    b) having a record of each article in the database 
  <% end %>
<% end %>

<%= para do %>
  In other words, if I add an article on my machine then redeploy the site, how can I ensure there is a record for the new article in the production database?
<% end %>

<%= para do %>
  First thing's first: when I create a database record for an article, it needs to <%= italic "correspond" %> to the article, which is just a file, whether I've created that record locally in my development database or in production or in other staging environments.
<% end %>

<%= para do %>
  The database record in each environment needs some reference to the article. The identifier can't be the record ID, which could be different in each environment. So I settled on each record having a <%= inline_code "view_id" %> which matches up with the article's filename. An Article record in production has the same <%= inline_code "view_id" %> referencing the same file as an Article record in my local database.
<% end %>

<%= para do %>
  Next: I need a source of truth, available in every environment, telling me which articles need a corresponding database record and what their <%= inline_code "view_id" %>s are, so after or during deployment, I can create any missing records. 
<% end %>

<%= para do %>
  This source of truth <%= italic "could" %> be the files themselves. But I though it might also be useful to create records with attributes <%= italic "other" %> than the filename (or <%= inline_code "view_id" %>). So I settled on a yaml file that (currently) lists each article's <%= inline_code "view_id" %> and initial title.
<% end %>

<%= para do %>
  Ultimately, then, adding an article means:
  <%= list do %>
    - adding an entry to the yaml file with a title and <%= inline_code "view_id" %>
    - creating a file with the <%= inline_code "view_id" %> as the filename
    - deploying the change and creating a database record for each entry in the yaml file that doesn't already have a record
  <% end %>
<% end %>

<%= para do %>
  And these steps are smoothed out by some custom rails commands. This one adds an entry to the <%= inline_code "articles.yml" %> file and creates a <%= inline_code "html.erb" %> file with a unique <%= inline_code "view_id" %> set as the filename:
  <%= code language: :shell do %>
    bin/rails add_article:execute --title="Hello World"
  <% end %>
  This one (run in each environment) ensures each article has a record in the database with the correct <%= inline_code "view_id" %>:
  <%= code language: :shell do %>
    bin/rails sync_articles:execute
  <% end %>
<% end %>

<%= para do %>
  So far, articles only have a title and a timestamp. No tags, likes or categories. But each article is both a file (which I can edit locally) and a record in an <%= inline_code "articles" %> table. So listing articles means fetching <%= inline_code "Article.recent_first" %>. Clicking an article takes you to <%= inline_code "/articles/:id" %>, where we fetch the correct article using <%= inline_code "Article.find(params[:id])" %>. 
<% end %>

<%= para do %>
  In the Article model, we define
  <%= code language: :ruby do %>
    def to_partial_path
      "articles/#{view_id}"
    end
  <% end %>
  which means we can render the article (in <%= inline_code "/articles/show.html" %>) like this:
  <%= code language: :ruby do %>
    <%%= render @article %>
  <% end %>
<% end %>

<%= para do %>
  And because an article is an <%= inline_code "html.erb" %> file...
<% end %>

<%= para do %>
  <%= code language: :ruby do %>
    <%%= para do %>
      <%%= code language: :ruby do %>
        I can do any old thing I want, like turn this paragraph into a 
        code snippet that shows the kind of helper methods I've written 
        to make writing an article pretty convenient
      <%% end %>
    <%% end %>
  <% end %>
<% end %>
